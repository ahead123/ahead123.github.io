     <!-- What are the benefits of version control? -->
     Git is version control. Version control is the awesome concept of being able to continuously write code, make changes, and always have the option to go back in time to a previous version. In a production - team environment, where many different developers are working collaboritively, it's essential to have a way to keep track of everyone's separate pieces, also known as branches, and that can later be merged back into one master version.
 </p>
 <p>
     <!-- How does git help you keep track of changes? -->
     Git keeps track of changes by saving snapshots of files, also known as commits. Once a git commit is recorded, git assigns a unique ID to this commit. A developer can run the command git log to see all the previous commit IDs and messages. Going back to a certain version is as simple as specifying git checkout and the ID that you'd like to revert back to.

    <!-- Why use GitHub to store your code? -->
    GitHub is like the FaceBook for developers and code. GitHub is the remote server that hosts code live on the internet that also lives on a local machine. By running the command git push, your code will leave your little protected local environment and now be available to the world in a public repository on GitHub. GitHub is the home of tons of open source code, that anyone can use, and make changes to as they see fit.
