      <!-- Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? -->
      <!--What is your impression of DBC? -->
      The DBC experience seems like it's going to encompass alot more than just learning how to program. After watching the fireside chat with Shareef, I got the sense that DBC would be an interesting life journey. I really get the sense that DBC is a place where you really get to know yourself and others in a way that usually doesn't happen. I really enjoyed how Shareef explains the different restaurant and kitchen mindsets that students, teachers, and even himself adopt about the program. It's great that DBC acknowledges, and is aware of these mindsets and welcomes them into learning journey. While listening to the definitions of the restaurant mindset, I immediately could relate to the examples and found myself doing some of the behaviors, like viewing the DBC experience as a product that one can order off a menu. I also could relate to the kitchen example, as I also can't wait to start hacking away at stuff with my other cohort mates. It was nice to hear Shareef say that it's quite common for both opposing mindsets to exist simultaneously.

      <!-- How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
      Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? -->
      I researched DBC quite a bit on the internet prior to applying, and also spoke and met with quite a few alumni, so I was somewhat aware of the culture at DBC. I've been pretty set and focused on becoming a great programmer, and my initial reaction to hearing that we may be spending time on anything but programming put me off a tad bit at first. Having majored in psychology, I've always been fascinated with human interactions. The way we act in different settings, being aware of our own comfort zones, and understanding our preconcieved notions are all the types of concepts I find interesting. I've come to a different conclusion about DBC's culture, and I think this will be a really neat way to go about the journey to learn to program.
