    There's a great need in the U.S. for more individuals to acquire the skills, and education necessary to fill the many vacant job openings in the Tech industries. The Obama Administration reported that by 2018 The U.S. will have more than 1.2 million job openings in STEM related occupation, many of which will go unfilled if some major changes don't occur. The traditional University system has struggled to educate computer science graduates at a fast enough pace to keep up with industry demand. Traditional university computer science programs will account for less than 16% of Bachelor degrees by 2020. In 2013 Amazon had 1,500 unfilled tech positions. There's quite a bit of speculation in the industry that blames Universities for not teaching curriculums that equip graduates with job ready tech skills. The overall lack of computer literacy in the general American population is also contributing to the employment problem. It's estimated that 96% of jobs use some sort of communication technology and 62% of jobs use the internet as an integral part of business. However 28% of Americans do not use the internet at all.

   Coding bootcamps offer one viable solution to alleviate some of the tech talent gap. While still a relatively new concept, a recent study by <a href ="https://www.coursereport.com">CourseReport.com</a> found that bootcamps will graduate over 16,000 students in 2015. That's an estimated growth rate of 138% over the 6,740 graduates in 2014. The same study found that in 2014 Universities graduated 48,700 computer science degrees, at that rate bootcamps would be on pace to meet the current rate of univerisites in a couple years, and dramatically increase the pool of tech talent.
