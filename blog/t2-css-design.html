 	<p>The box model is a particular theory or way of viewing elements on a web page. The box model takes the position that every element on a page is a box. The box consist of some properties which are: margin, border, padding, width and height.</p>

	<p>The innermost element of the box which usually is the content, is what initially determines the width and height of the element. The width and height can also be set using the CSS width and height values. Padding can be used to expand the box outward. Padding can be spread equally throughout the box or it can be fine tuned to left, right, top, and bottom values. A good way to think of padding, is like a macho man puffing out his chest.</p>

	<p>Just outside the element's padding, is the border. border is the outermost edge around the content. It's like an outline. Border's can be set to different widths and thicknesses, and can also change color. Border's lie between the content and the margin. Border also can be fine tuned to left, right, top, and bottom values.
	</p>

	<p>Margin is the outermost piece of an element. You can think of margin as a force field for everything inside of it. Margin determines how far a particular box is positioned from the next box. Elements can have positive and negative margin. Since margin also has independent top, bottom, left, and right values, you could give a box a margin-top of -10px and a margin bottom of 10px.</p>
