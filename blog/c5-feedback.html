 	<p>Up to this point in week-5 we've done a fair amount of pair programming. As the weeks go on I actually look forward to pair programming more and more. I get a bit nervous before the session when wondering how the other person will be but once the session starts and I meet my pair, all of that nervousness goes away. I look forward to pairing because I've noticed that while pairing, I'm able to solve challenges alot faster than I would on my own. I also like that during pairing, both people have to talk out loud what each other is thinking. This increases the learning experience greatly as I get to practice talking and teaching and vice versa.</p>

	<p>The other piece of pair programming is giving and receiving feedback. I think the Dev Bootcamp videos did a really good job of giving us a proper background, and framework for giving and receiving feedback. The feedback in this program has been really good. Most of the feedback I read about others and the feedback given to me, has been honest, specific, kind, and actionable. Writing constructive feedback can be tough. When writing constructive feedback I flashback to what the DBC videos said about not doing the shit sandwich, and to just speak the truth. And also to not undercut the receivers ability to recieve constructive feedback.</p>

  <p>Now that we're in week 5 and the feedback is rolling in, it's cool to look over the feedback I recieved and look for patterns or trends. One piece of feedback I've received multiple times is to be more assertive. I've heard a few times that my ideas were helpful and to not be afraid to say them. That's been really helpful to hear and I've tried to stay conscious of that going forward. All in all feedback is really helpful to the overall DBC experience.</p>
