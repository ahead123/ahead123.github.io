 	<p>While taking the Gregoric Thinking Style personal thinking quiz during pre-Phase-0, I scored in the category of Concrete Random. Individuals in this category like to experiment, take risks, and solve problems independently. They don't like keeping detailed records, showing how they got to an answer, or routines. These are just some of the characteristics but I chose to point these out because I see myself having these characteristics.</p>

	<p>So far in Phase-0, the majority of our work is done remote so I've been able to be in my comfort zone of solving problems primarily by myself. Although I know working alone is something I like, I also am aware of the benefits of working on a team. During my pair programming sessions I've found that I really enjoy working and talking with others to solve a problem. It feels a little strange at first, not being able to do it all, but I've noticed it's helped me practice speaking my thoughts out loud, which is something I don't always get the opportunity to do.</p>

	<p>Reading and learning about Carol Dweck's theory on fixed vs. growth mindsets was a very powerful read for me. It's actually a pretty simple concept to adopt, but it always amazes me how the mind can unconsciously set itself on auto-pilot and have a huge positive or negative impact on one's outcome. After reading more about mindset's I now find myself constantly spot checking myself in certain situations. At work when faced with a tough problem, where I'd usually probably gravitate to the failure fixed mindset, I now catch myself mid-stride and switch on the growth mindset and instead reassure myself that the uncomfortableness associated with not knowing an answer is the result of being in the moment of learning, and the answer is near, so don't give up.</p>
